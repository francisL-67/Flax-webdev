  you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"> official birthday of the Internet</a> is January 1st,1983? Even though it came into existence then, 
  it didn't gain the popularity we know now until at least a decade later, 
  when it became more common to have home computers and home computers with an internet connection. 
</p>
<p> 
  In the year 2000, only 50% of US Adults said they used the internet, 
  and less than 5% of homes had high speed internet access. 
  That means a lot of things we found common place couldn't be done yet! 
  (And without high speed internet, you had to listen to a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDS4B0mM-ew">scary sound</a> to get online.)
